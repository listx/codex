* Problem statement

Given N objects colored red, white, or blue, sort them so that objects of the same colors are grouped together. The groups should be red, white, and blue. [cite:@epip 43]. Bonus: return the number of red and white objects, if any.

* Insights

Instead of 3 colors, we can have any other kind of property. For example, we could say "less than the middle number", "equal to the middle number", and "greater than the middle number". Seen this way, the /partition/ step of quicksort (where the "middle number" is called the /pivot/) is closely related.

If we just consider 2 colors, then this is essentially the same as the [[file:~/prog/codex/problem/rearrange_list_even_odd/README.org]["Rearrange list"]] problem which partitioned a list of numbers into 2 groups, all even (if any) and odd (if any). There we used 2 indices to keep track of the left (even) and right (odd) groups, and we had 3 subgroups: even, unknown, odd. We shrank the unknown group to 0, and when this happened (when the even and odd indices crossed each other), we were done.

For arranging 3 colors, we could use 3 indices (red, white, blue), and keep track of 4 subgroups: red, white, unknown, blue. Everything starts as "unknown", but we whittle this down to 0 (when the white and blue indices cross).

* Solution

For our solution, we don't use colors and instead use quicksort's naming scheme.

#+begin_src python
def dutch_flag_partition(nums, idx_pivot):
  if not nums:
    return 0, 0

  # If the given idx_pivot is out of bounds, just use 0. This is the pivot
  # *index*, so we will use the value (whatever it is) at index 0 as the pivot.
  if idx_pivot < 0 or idx_pivot > (len(nums) - 1):
    idx_pivot = 0

  pivot = nums[idx_pivot]
  # Track numbers less than pivot.
  idx_lt = 0
  # Track numbers equal to pivot.
  idx_eq = 0
  # Track numbers greater than pivot. Note that this index is out-of-bounds.
  idx_gt = len(nums)

  while idx_eq < idx_gt:
    if nums[idx_eq] == pivot:
      idx_eq += 1
    elif nums[idx_eq] < pivot:
      nums[idx_lt], nums[idx_eq] = nums[idx_eq], nums[idx_lt]
      idx_lt += 1
      idx_eq += 1
    else:
      idx_gt -= 1
      nums[idx_eq], nums[idx_gt] = nums[idx_gt], nums[idx_eq]

  # Return (1) the count of numbers less than the pivot, and (2) the count of
  # numbers equal to the pivot.

  return idx_lt, idx_eq - idx_lt
#+end_src

The =while= condition

#+begin_src python
  while idx_eq < idx_gt:
#+end_src

just checks whether we still have some nonzero size of unchecked numbers (in group "unknown").

As we iterate through the loop, we always check the number pointed by =idx_eq= (similar to how we always kept an eye on =idx_odd= in [[file:~/prog/codex/problem/rearrange_list_even_odd/README.org]["Rearrange list"]]).

Now let's consider the simplest case:

#+begin_src python
    if nums[idx_eq] == pivot:
      idx_eq += 1
#+end_src

This is straightforward --- if =idx_eq= is looking at a number that is equal to the pivot, we "count" it by incrementing =idx_eq=. This is the happy path.

Now let's examine the case where =idx_eq= is pointing to a number less than the pivot:

#+begin_src python
    elif nums[idx_eq] < pivot:
      nums[idx_lt], nums[idx_eq] = nums[idx_eq], nums[idx_lt]
      idx_lt += 1
      idx_eq += 1
#+end_src

In this case, =idx_eq= just found a number smaller than the pivot, so it "trades" it with =idx_lt= via a swap. We must increment =idx_lt= because it "grew" by 1 number.

But how come we increment =idx_eq= here? Don't we need to examine the number that was swapped in on the next iteration (/without/ incrementing =idx_eq=)? To answer this question, let's look at the 2 possibilities for =idx_lt= and =idx_eq=: (1) these indices are equal (such as in the very first iteration of the loop when both are 0), or (2) =idx_eq= has gotten ahead of =idx_lt= by running the first if-branch when =num[idx_eq]= is equal to =pivot=. In both cases we want to increment =idx_eq=.

For the first case, the swap is a NOP. We want to increment =idx_eq= here because we want to examine the next number in the list.

For the second case, this means that at some point, =idx_eq= advanced /on its own/, leaving =idx_lt= behind. The only way that =idx_eq= can advance on its own is if =nums[idx_eq]= is equal to the pivot. This means that when =idx_eq= first got ahead of =idx_lt=, they were *both* pointing to a number P which was equal to the pivot (after which =idx_eq= advanced on its own, per the first if-branch). So when =idx_eq= sees a number smaller than the pivot, it knows that =idx_lt=, which fell behind, is *already* looking at a number equal to the pivot! So after the swap, =idx_eq= is pointing at P again (and so it must advance). This is a little tricky, so let's see an example.

Here we expect =idx_lt= and =idx_eq= to both advance in lockstep for some time, as we keep hitting =0= initially which is less than the pivot.

#+begin_example
pivot = 1

0  0  0  1  0  0  1  (numbers)
0  1  2  3  4  5  6  (list index)
|
`- idx_lt
|
`- idx_eq
#+end_example

When we see =1=, =idx_eq= advances on its own. Note how =idx_lt= "saves" an element *equal* to the pivot (by continuing to point to it) for a possible future swap with =idx_eq=.

#+begin_example
0  0  0  1  0  0  1  (numbers)
0  1  2  3  4  5  6  (list index)
         |
         `- idx_lt
         |
         `- idx_eq
#+end_example

This is the critical step. =idx_eq= is looking at a number smaller than the pivot...

#+begin_example
0  0  0  1  0  0  1  (numbers)
0  1  2  3  4  5  6  (list index)
         |  |
         `- idx_lt
            |
            `- idx_eq
#+end_example

...so it performs a swap! Both =idx_eq= and =idx_lt= got what they wanted, respectively, so we must increment both of them.

#+begin_example
0  0  0  0  1  0  1  (numbers)
0  1  2  3  4  5  6  (list index)
         |  |
         `- idx_lt
            |
            `- idx_eq
#+end_example

So much for the interplay between =idx_lt= and =idx_eq=. Now we come to the final condition where =idx_eq= sees a number /greater/ than the pivot:

#+begin_src python
    else:
      idx_gt -= 1
      nums[idx_eq], nums[idx_gt] = nums[idx_gt], nums[idx_eq]
#+end_src

In this case, we "throw over" the number to the right side of the list (to =idx_gt=), and in return get the number that =idx_gt= (whatever it may be) pointed to. Because of of-by-one issues, we have to decrement =idx_gt= first. Note that we *do not* increment =idx_eq= here, because we have no idea what =idx_gt= was pointing at previously.
